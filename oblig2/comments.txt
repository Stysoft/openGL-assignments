First of all, I didn't change the getProjectionMatrix function, because of the reasons I specified in the latest email.
Secondly, I don't really get why I even compute the angle and the axis aside from the debugging.

I went through my past email questions and after doing the assignment I think that some of them didn't make much sense :)
